<div className="lead-paragraph">
We've all done it. You're stuck on a complex database connection error at 2 AM. You copy the entire `db.config.ts` file, paste it into ChatGPT, and hit enter. Three seconds later, you realize you just handed your production database credentials to an external AI provider.
</div>

<div className="warning-box">
**🛑 Stop!** In 2025, the number one cause of cloud security breaches wasn't sophisticated hacking—it was developers accidentally pasting `.env` contents and API keys into public tools.
</div>

## The "Context" Trap

To get good answers from Claude 3.5 or GPT-4o, you need to provide context. The more code you paste, the better the fix. But code is full of secrets:

*   **API Keys:** Stripe, AWS, OpenAI keys.
*   **Database Strings:** `postgres://user:password@host...`
*   **Internal IPs:** Revealing your internal network topology.
*   **Pipes & Tokens:** CI/CD secrets often hardcoded during debugging.

## Real-World Horror Story

<div className="quote-box">
"A junior dev pasted a proprietary algorithm into a public LLM to optimize it. Two weeks later, similar code snippets started appearing in the model's suggestions for other users. The IP was lost."
</div>

This isn't theoretical. Major companies like Samsung have banned internal use of generative AI precisely because of these leaks. But banning AI puts your team at a disadvantage. The solution isn't to stop using AI—it's to **scrub the context.**

## What You Need to Scrub (Checklist)

Before you paste *any* code block, check for these three things:

### 1. Hardcoded Secrets
Even if you use environment variables, debugging code often has commented-out keys.

```typescript
// const STRIPE_KEY = "sk_live_51Mz..." <-- DANGER
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_KEY);
```

### 2. PII in Test Data
If you paste a JSON dump of a failed request, ensure it doesn't contain real customer data.

<div className="example-container">
<div className="example-before">
**❌ Unsafe JSON:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "email": "real.customer@gmail.com",
  "cc_last4": "4242"
}
```
</div>
</div>

### 3. Internal URLs
Don't expose your staging or admin panel URLs (e.g., `admin-staging.internal.corp`).

## The Secure Workflow: Code → Scrub → Debug

You don't need to manually delete keys every time. That's slow and error-prone. Use a dedicated PII scrubber like SafetyLayer to automate the hygiene.

**Copy Broken Code**

**Run Through SafetyLayer**
Paste it into the input. We automatically detect credit cards, emails, and (coming soon) high-entropy API keys.

**Debug with AI**
Paste the sanitized code into ChatGPT. The AI understands the logic even if the specific values are tokenized.
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div className="tip-box">
💡 **Did you know?** LLMs are excellent at abstract reasoning. If you replace an API key with `[API_KEY_1]`, the AI understands it's a variable and will still solve your logic error perfectly.
</div>
## Automation is Key

Manual redaction fails because humans are tired and lazy. By using a tool that sits between your clipboard and the AI, you create a "Safety Layer" that catches mistakes before they become breaches.

Don't let a moment of frustration turn into a security incident report. Scrub your code, keep your job.
<div className="cta-inline">
**Try it now:** Paste your error logs into SafetyLayer and see how much PII you were about to leak.
</div>
